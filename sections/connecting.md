# Connecting to AccelerateAI

AccelerateAI is accessed via the same login nodes as the Supercomputing Wales SUNBIRD system, and shared the same file storage.

## Username and password

SUNBIRD uses a separate system of user accounts to Swansea University, so has an entirely separate password. To set your password to access AccelerateAI

* Log in to the [MySCW](myscw) service
* Click the "Reset SCW Password" button
* Choose a new password, and click "Submit"
* While you are looking at MySCW, take a note of your "SCW username" on the dashboard. You will need this.

It may take up to a minute or two for the new password to take effect. You will receive an email to confirm your password has been set.

If you ever forget your password and need to reset it, please follow the above steps again.

## Connecting

Connection is via SSH to `sunbird.swansea.ac.uk`, using the username and password discussed above. For more details on connecting, please visit the [Supercomputing Wales Portal page on accessing the system](portal-access).

## Locked out?

If you repeatedly try to log in unsuccessfully (for example, you type the wrong password, or cancel logging in before submitting your password), then the system may lock you out. This will automatically reset after a few hours; if you need access more quickly, please raise a ticket with the [Supercomputing Wales service desk](scw-ticket). To allow the support desk to assist as quickly as possible, please include [your IP address](whatsmyip) in your request.
