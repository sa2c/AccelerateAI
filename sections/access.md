# Getting access to AccelerateAI

Access to AccelerateAI is managed through the Supercomputing Wales [MySCW][myscw] service.

## Registering for MySCW

If you are new to Supercomputing Wales, then you will need to register for access.

Visit the [MySCW][myscw] portal, and log in with your University credentials. You will be asked to give a reason for registration; a brief one-sentence summary is fine at this stage, as you will give more specific detail about the research you will be conducting in the next step.

Your account will be manually reviewed and approved. If you have not received notification that your account is approved within one week, please contact [SA2C support][sa2csupport].

## Joining a project

If you are working with an existing AccelerateAI user who already has a project, you can request to join it once your MySCW account is approved.

To do this, first ask the technical lead of the project what the Supercomputing Wales project code for the project is. (It will be `scw` followed by a four-digit number, e.g. `scw0123`.) visit [MySCW][myscw], and in the "Join a Project" box at the top of the page, enter the project code, and click "Join". The technical lead of the project will be sent a request to approve your membership; once they do this, you will have access.

## Creating a project

If your research doesn't already have a Supercomputing Wales project associated with AccelerateAI, then you will need to create a new one. (If you already use Supercomputing Wales, you will need to apply for a new project in order to use AccelerateAI.) To do this, visit [MySCW][myscw], and in the menu on the left-hand side, click "Create Project Application". The project form requests a number of details about the research you will be doing.

Please use the "Project Description" field to outline what research you will be performing, and mention that you will be using AccelerateAI, as well as how the AccelerateAI facilities will enable you to get the results you are looking for. Please also specify what academic outputs (publications, conference talks, grant proposals) will be enabled by the project.

Applications are reviewed weekly. The review process is primarily to ensure that the machine is able to meet your needs, and that we have enough information to let our funders know what we are using their resources for. If there are any problems with the form, we will get in touch for more information. If you have not had a response to your application within a week of submission, please get in touch with [SA2C Support][sa2csupport].
